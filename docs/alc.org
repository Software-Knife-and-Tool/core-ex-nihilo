* ALC - A Lisp Compiler
  This project is a multi-pass compiler for the Gyre language.
* ALC Architecture
  This compiler is composed of libraries, structured as a series of transformations.
  1. System interface (compiler.l)
  2. AST (compiler/ast)
     + (ast (lex sexpr))
     + convert sexpr to AST
     + replace all nodes with (:type . value)
  3. Macro/pecial forms resolved
     + (form (ast (lex sepr)))
     + reduce all forms to function calls
  4. Optimizer (compiler/opt)
     + (opt (form (ast (lex sexpr))))
     + constant folding
     + strength reduction
  5. Register Model (compiler/reg-model)
     + (reg (opt (form (ast (lex sexpr)))))
     + convert to RM language
  6. Code emitter (compiler/emit)
     + (emit model (reg (opt (form (ast (lex sexpr))))))
     + models: 'aarch64, 'x86-64, 'llvm
     + write output file
