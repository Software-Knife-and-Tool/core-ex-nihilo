* ALC - A Lisp Compiler
  This project is a multi-pass machine-code compiler for Gyre.
  + output format? LLVM?
* ALC Architecture
  This compiler is composed of a series of Gyre libraries, structured as a number of passes.
  1. lexical analysis (compiler/lex)
     + mostly done by mu reader
     + (lex sexpr)
  2. AST (compiler/ast)
     + (ast (lex sexpr))
     + convert sexpr to AST
     + replace all nodes with (sexpr . :type)
  3. Optimizer (compiler/opt)
     + (opt (ast (lex seexpr)))
     + constant folding
  4. Code emitter (compiler/emit)
     + write machine code output file
